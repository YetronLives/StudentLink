# StudentLink
A solution that brings all your projects to one place

<br>

## Problem Statement

With today's competitive job market, students are not just expected to showcase academic expertise but also real-world, tangible experience with projects. However, most students lack any experience outside of coursework to showcase, which places them at a disadvantage upon applying for internships or full-time employment. Student Link addresses this issue by providing a platform where students have access to curated project ideas, learning resources, and progress-tracking tools to build strong, skill-based portfolios. By guiding the student through frontend, backend, AI/ML, cybersecurity, and cloud computing projects, Student Link bridges the gap between school learning and industry needs, allowing students to gain experience and self-confidence.
